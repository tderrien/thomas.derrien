abstract: White coat color in mammals has been selected several times during the domestication
  process. Numerous dog breeds are fixed for one form of white coat color that involves
  darkly pigmented skin. The genetic basis of this color, due to the absence of pigment
  in the hairs, was suggested to correspond to extreme dilution of the phaeomelanin,
  by both the expression of only phaeomelanin (locus E) and its extreme dilution (locus
  I). To go further, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a multiple
  breed approach. The first GWAS, using 34 white dogs and 128 non-white dogs, including
  White Shepherds, Poodles, Cotons de Tulear and Bichons allowed us to identify two
  significantly associated loci on the locus E and a novel locus on chromosome 20.
  A second GWAS using 15 other breeds presenting extreme phaeomelanin dilution confirmed
  the position of locus I on the chromosome 20 (position 55 Mb pcorrected = 6 x 10(-13)).
  Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified a missense variant in the first exon
  of MFSD12, a gene recently identified to be involved in human, mouse and horse pigmentation.
  We confirmed the role of this variant in phaeomelanin dilution of numerous canine
  breeds, and the conserved role of MFSD12 in mammalian pigmentation.
