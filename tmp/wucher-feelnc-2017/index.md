abstract: Whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a standard for cataloguing
  and monitoring RNA populations. One of the main bottlenecks, however, is to correctly
  identify the different classes of RNAs among the plethora of reconstructed transcripts,
  particularly those that will be translated (mRNAs) from the class of long non-coding
  RNAs (lncRNAs). Here, we present FEELnc (FlExible Extraction of LncRNAs), an alignment-free
  program that accurately annotates lncRNAs based on a Random Forest model trained
  with general features such as multi k-mer frequencies and relaxed open reading frames.
  Benchmarking versus five state-of-the-art tools shows that FEELnc achieves similar
  or better classification performance on GENCODE and NONCODE data sets. The program
  also provides specific modules that enable the user to fine-tune classification
  accuracy, to formalize the annotation of lncRNA classes and to identify lncRNAs
  even in the absence of a training set of non-coding RNAs. We used FEELnc on a real
  data set comprising 20 canine RNA-seq samples produced by the European LUPA consortium
  to substantially expand the canine genome annotation to include 10 374 novel lncRNAs
  and 58 640 mRNA transcripts. FEELnc moves beyond conventional coding potential classifiers
  by providing a standardized and complete solution for annotating lncRNAs and is
