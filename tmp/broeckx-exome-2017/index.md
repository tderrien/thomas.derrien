abstract: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to identify loci
  associated with phenotypic traits in the domestic dog that has emerged as a model
  for Mendelian and complex traits. However, a disadvantage of GWAS is that it always
  requires subsequent fine-mapping or sequencing to pinpoint causal mutations. Here,
  we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and canine high-density (cHD) SNP genotyping
  of 28 dogs from 3 breeds to compare the SNP and linkage disequilibrium characteristics
  together with the power and mapping precision of exome-guided GWAS (EG-GWAS) versus
  cHD-based GWAS. Using simulated phenotypes, we showed that EG-GWAS has a higher
  power than cHD to detect associations within target regions and less power outside
  target regions, with power being influenced further by sample size and SNP density.
  We analyzed two real phenotypes (hair length and furnishing), that are fixed in
  certain breeds to characterize mapping precision of the known causal mutations.
  EG-GWAS identified the associated exonic and 3'UTR variants within the FGF5 and
  RSPO2 genes, respectively, with only a few samples per breed. In conclusion, we
  demonstrated that EG-GWAS can identify loci associated with Mendelian phenotypes
  both within and across breeds.
