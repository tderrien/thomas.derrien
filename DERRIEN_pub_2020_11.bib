abstract = {By limiting sequencing to those sequences transcribed as mRNA, whole exome sequencing is a cost-efficient technique often used in disease-association studies. We developed two target enrichment designs based on the recently released annotation of the canine genome: the exome-plus design and the exome-CDS design. The exome-plus design combines the exons of the CanFam 3.1 Ensembl annotation, more recently discovered protein-coding exons and a variety of non-coding RNA regions (microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and antisense transcripts), leading to a total size of approximately 152 Mb. The exome-CDS was designed as a subset of the exome-plus by omitting all 3' and 5' untranslated regions. This reduced the size of the exome-CDS to approximately 71 Mb. To test the capturing performance, four exome-plus captures were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 with each capture containing four pre-capture pooled, barcoded samples. At an average sequencing depth of 68.3x, 80{\%} of the regions and well over 90{\%} of the targeted base pairs were completely covered at least 5 times with high reproducibility. Based on the performance of the exome-plus, we estimated the performance of the exome-CDS. Overall, these designs provide flexible solutions for a variety of research questions and are likely to be reliable tools in disease studies.},

abstract = {The transcriptome of a cell is represented by a myriad of different RNA molecules with and without protein-coding capacities. In recent years, advances in sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to more fully appreciate the complexity of whole transcriptomes, showing that the vast majority of the genome is transcribed, producing a diverse population of non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Thus, the biological significance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been largely underestimated. Amongst these multiple classes of ncRNAs, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are apparently the most numerous and functionally diverse. A small but growing number of lncRNAs have been experimentally studied, and a view is emerging that these are key regulators of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian cells. LncRNAs have already been implicated in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, highlighting the importance of this emergent field. In this article, we review the catalogs of annotated lncRNAs and the latest advances in our understanding of lncRNAs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coat colours in canines have many natural phenotypic variants. Some of the genes and alleles involved also cause genetic developmental defects, which are also observed in humans and mice. We studied the genetic bases of the merle phenotype in dogs to shed light on the pigmentation mechanisms and to identify genes involved in these complex pathways. The merle phenotype includes a lack of eumelanic pigmentation and developmental defects, hearing impairments and microphthalmia. It is similar to that observed in microphthalmia mouse mutants. RESULTS: Taking advantage of the dog as a powerful genetic model and using recently available genomic resources, we investigated the segregation of the merle phenotype in a five-generation pedigree, comprising 96 sampled Australian shepherd dogs. Genetic linkage analysis allowed us to identify a locus for the merle phenotype, spanning 5.5 megabases, at the centromeric tip of canine chromosome 10 (CFA10). This locus was supported by a Lod score of 15.65 at a recombination fraction theta = 0. Linkage analysis in three other breeds revealed that the same region is linked to the merle phenotype. This region, which is orthologous to human chromosome 12 (HSA12 q13-q14), belongs to a conserved ordered segment in the human and mouse genome and comprises several genes potentially involved in pigmentation and development. CONCLUSION: This study has identified the locus for the merle coat colour in dogs to be at the centromeric end of CFA10. Genetic studies on other breeds segregating the merle phenotype should allow the locus to be defined more accurately with the aim of identifying the gene. This work shows the power of the canine system to search for the genetic bases of mammalian pigmentation and developmental pathways.},

abstract = {The identification of dog genes and their accurate localization to chromosomes remain a major challenge in the postgenomics era. The 132 annotated canine genes with human orthologs remaining in the unassembled part (chrUnknown) of the dog sequence assembly (CanFam1) are of limited use for candidate gene approaches or comparative mapping studies. We used a two-step comparative analysis to infer a canine chromosomal interval for localization of the chrUn genes. We first constructed a human-dog synteny map, using 14,456 gene-based comparative anchors. We then mapped the 132 chrUn genes onto the reference (human) synteny map and identified the corresponding, orthologous segment on the canine map, based on conserved gene order. Our results show that 110 chrUn genes could be localized to short intervals on 18 dog chromosomes, whereas 22 genes remained assigned to 2 possible intervals. We extended this comparative analysis to multiple species, using the chimpanzee, mouse, and rat genome sequences. This made it possible to narrow down the intervals concerned and to increase the number of canine chrUn genes with an inferred chromosome location to 115. This study demonstrates that dog chromosomal intervals for chrUn genes can be rapidly inferred, using a reference species, and indicates that comparative strategies based on larger numbers of species may be even more effective.},

@article{Howald2012,
abstract = {Within the ENCODE Consortium, GENCODE aimed to accurately annotate all protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, and noncoding transcribed loci in the human genome through manual curation and computational methods. Annotated transcript structures were assessed, and less well-supported loci were systematically, experimentally validated. Predicted exon-exon junctions were evaluated by RT-PCR amplification followed by highly multiplexed sequencing readout, a method we called RT-PCR-seq. Seventy-nine percent of all assessed junctions are confirmed by this evaluation procedure, demonstrating the high quality of the GENCODE gene set. RT-PCR-seq was also efficient to screen gene models predicted using the Human Body Map (HBM) RNA-seq data. We validated 73{\%} of these predictions, thus confirming 1168 novel genes, mostly noncoding, which will further complement the GENCODE annotation. Our novel experimental validation pipeline is extremely sensitive, far more than unbiased transcriptome profiling through RNA sequencing, which is becoming the norm. For example, exon-exon junctions unique to GENCODE annotated transcripts are five times more likely to be corroborated with our targeted approach than with extensive large human transcriptome profiling. Data sets such as the HBM and ENCODE RNA-seq data fail sampling of low-expressed transcripts. Our RT-PCR-seq targeted approach also has the advantage of identifying novel exons of known genes, as we discovered unannotated exons in {\~{}}11{\%} of assessed introns. We thus estimate that at least 18{\%} of known loci have yet-unannotated exons. Our work demonstrates that the cataloging of all of the genic elements encoded in the human genome will necessitate a coordinated effort between unbiased and targeted approaches, like RNA-seq and RT-PCR-seq.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative genomics studies are central in identifying the coding and non-coding elements associated with complex traits, and the functional annotation of genomes is a critical step to decipher the genotype-to-phenotype relationships in livestock animals. As part of the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) action, the FR-AgENCODE project aimed to create reference functional maps of domesticated animals by profiling the landscape of transcription (RNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and conformation (Hi-C) in species representing ruminants (cattle, goat), monogastrics (pig) and birds (chicken), using three target samples related to metabolism (liver) and immunity (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). RESULTS: RNA-seq assays considerably extended the available catalog of annotated transcripts and identified differentially expressed genes with unknown function, including new syntenic lncRNAs. ATAC-seq highlighted an enrichment for transcription factor binding sites in differentially accessible regions of the chromatin. Comparative analyses revealed a core set of conserved regulatory regions across species. Topologically associating domains (TADs) and epigenetic A/B compartments annotated from Hi-C data were consistent with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Multi-species comparisons showed that conserved TAD boundaries had stronger insulation properties than species-specific ones and that the genomic distribution of orthologous genes in A/B compartments was significantly conserved across species. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first multi-species and multi-assay genome annotation results obtained by a FAANG project. Beyond the generation of reference annotations and the confirmation of previous findings on model animals, the integrative analysis of data from multiple assays and species sheds a new light on the multi-scale selective pressure shaping genome organization from birds to mammals. Overall, these results emphasize the value of FAANG for research on domesticated animals and reinforces the importance of future meta-analyses of the reference datasets being generated by this community on different species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improving functional annotation of the chicken genome is a key challenge in bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype. Among all transcribed regions, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a major component of the transcriptome and its regulation, and whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has greatly improved their identification and characterization. We performed an extensive profiling of the lncRNA transcriptome in the chicken liver and adipose tissue by RNA-Seq. We focused on these two tissues because of their importance in various economical traits for which energy storage and mobilization play key roles and also because of their high cell homogeneity. To predict lncRNAs, we used a recently developed tool called FEELnc, which also classifies them with respect to their distance and strand orientation to the closest protein-coding genes. Moreover, to confidently identify the genes/transcripts expressed in each tissue (a complex task for weakly expressed molecules such as lncRNAs), we probed a particularly large number of biological replicates (16 per tissue) compared to common multi-tissue studies with a larger set of tissues but less sampling. RESULTS: We predicted 2193 lncRNA genes, among which 1670 were robustly expressed across replicates in the liver and/or adipose tissue and which were classified into 1493 intergenic and 177 intragenic lncRNAs located between and within protein-coding genes, respectively. We observed similar structural features between chickens and mammals, with strong synteny conservation but without sequence conservation. As previously reported, we confirm that lncRNAs have a lower and more tissue-specific expression than mRNAs. Finally, we showed that adjacent lncRNA-mRNA genes in divergent orientation have a higher co-expression level when separated by less than 1 kb compared to more distant divergent pairs. Among these, we highlighted for the first time a novel lncRNA candidate involved in lipid metabolism, lnc{\_}DHCR24, which is highly correlated with the DHCR24 gene that encodes a key enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive lncRNA repertoire in the chicken liver and adipose tissue, which shows interesting patterns of co-expression between mRNAs and lncRNAs. It contributes to improving the structural and functional annotation of the chicken genome and provides a basis for further studies on energy storage and mobilization traits in the chicken.},

abstract = {Our vision of DNA transcription and splicing has changed dramatically with the introduction of short-read sequencing. These high-throughput sequencing technologies promised to unravel the complexity of any transcriptome. Generally gene expression levels are well-captured using these technologies, but there are still remaining caveats due to the limited read length and the fact that RNA molecules had to be reverse transcribed before sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently launched a portable sequencer which offers the possibility of sequencing long reads and most importantly RNA molecules. Here we generated a full mouse transcriptome from brain and liver using the Oxford Nanopore device. As a comparison, we sequenced RNA (RNA-Seq) and cDNA (cDNA-Seq) molecules using both long and short reads technologies and tested the TeloPrime preparation kit, dedicated to the enrichment of full-length transcripts. Using spike-in data, we confirmed that expression levels are efficiently captured by cDNA-Seq using short reads. More importantly, Oxford Nanopore RNA-Seq tends to be more efficient, while cDNA-Seq appears to be more biased. We further show that the cDNA library preparation of the Nanopore protocol induces read truncation for transcripts containing internal runs of T's. This bias is marked for runs of at least 15 T's, but is already detectable for runs of at least 9 T's and therefore concerns more than 20{\%} of expressed transcripts in mouse brain and liver. Finally, we outline that bioinformatics challenges remain ahead for quantifying at the transcript level, especially when reads are not full-length. Accurate quantification of repeat-associated genes such as processed pseudogenes also remains difficult, and we show that current mapping protocols which map reads to the genome largely over-estimate their expression, at the expense of their parent gene.},

A large set of long ncRNAs is transcribed independent of protein-coding genes. We have used the GENCODE annotation of the human genome to identify 3019 long ncRNAs expressed in various human cell lines and tissue. This set of long ncRNAs responds to differentiation signals in primary human keratinocytes and is coexpressed with important regulators of keratinocyte development. Depletion of a number of these long ncRNAs leads to the repression of specific genes in their surrounding locus, supportive of an activating function for ncRNAs. Using reporter assays, we confirmed such activating function and show that such transcriptional enhancement is mediated through the long ncRNA transcripts. Our studies show that long ncRNAs exhibit functions similar to classically defined enhancers, through an RNA-dependent mechanism.},

In addition, we show that mappability varies greatly between species and gene classes. Finally, we suggest several practical applications where mappability can be used to refine the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data (SNP calling, gene expression quantification and paired-end experiments).

The cohort included 73 dogs with oral melanoma confirmed by histology, removed surgically without adjuvant therapy and with a minimal follow-up of 6 months. Epidemiological, clinical and histological data were collected and quantitative-PCR were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples to identify specific focal amplifications. The 73 dogs included in the study had a median survival time of 220 days. Focal amplifications on CFA 10 and 30 were recurrent (49.3{\%} and 50.7{\%} of cases, respectively) and CFA 30 amplification was significantly associated with the amelanotic phenotype (P = .046) and high mitotic index (MI; P = .0039). CFA 30 amplification was also linked to poor prognosis (P = .0005). Other negative prognostic factors included gingiva location (P = .003), lymphadenomegaly (P = .026), tumour ulceration at diagnosis (P = .003), MI superior to 6 mitoses over 10 fields (P = .001) and amelanotic tumour (P = .029). In multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression, CFA 30 amplification (Hazard ratio [HR] = 2.08; P = .011), tumour location (HR = 2.20; P = .005) and histological pigmentation (HR = 1.87; P = .036) were significantly associated with shorter survival time. Focal amplification of CFA 30 is linked to an aggressive subset and constitutes a new prognostic factor.},

The genome sequence of the domestic dog was assembled and released in 2005, providing an estimated 20,000 protein-coding genes that are a great asset to the scientific community that uses the dog system as a genetic biomedical model and for comparative and evolutionary studies. Although the canine gene set had been predicted using a combination of ab initio methods, homology studies, motif analysis, and similarity-based programs, it still requires a deep annotation of noncoding genes, alternative splicing, pseudogenes, regulatory regions, and gain and loss events. Such analyses could benefit from new sequencing technologies (RNA-Seq) to better exploit the advantages of the canine genetic system in tracking disease genes. Here, we review the catalog of canine protein-coding genes and the search for missing genes, and we propose rationales for an accurate identification of noncoding genes though next-generation sequencing.},

Lower sequence coverage (survey sequencing) of related species can yield a wealth of information about gene content and putative regulatory elements.

Here we show the usefulness of combining survey sequencing with dense radiation-hybrid (RH) maps for extracting maximum comparative genome information from model organisms. Based on results from the canine system, we propose that from now on all low-pass sequencing projects should be accompanied by a dense, gene-based RH map-construction effort to extract maximum information from the genome with a marginal extra cost.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome maps are fundamental to the study of an organism and essential in the process of genome sequencing which in turn provides the ultimate map of the genome. The increased number of genomes being sequenced offers new opportunities for the mapping of closely related organisms. We propose here an algorithmic formalization of a genome comparison approach to marker ordering. RESULTS: In order to integrate a comparative mapping approach in the algorithmic process of map construction and selection, we propose to extend the usual statistical model describing the experimental data, here radiation hybrids (RH) data, in a statistical framework that models additionally the evolutionary relationships between a proposed map and a reference map: an existing map of the corresponding orthologous genes or markers in a closely related organism. This has concretely the effect of exploiting, in the process of map selection, the information of marker adjacencies in the related genome when the information provided by the experimental data is not conclusive for the purpose of ordering. In order to compute efficiently the map, we proceed to a reduction of the maximum likelihood estimation to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Experiments on simulated RH datasets as well as on a real RH dataset from the canine RH project show that maps produced using the likelihood defined by the new model are significantly better than maps built using the traditional RH model.

abstract = {White coat color in mammals has been selected several times during the domestication process. Numerous dog breeds are fixed for one form of white coat color that involves darkly pigmented skin. The genetic basis of this color, due to the absence of pigment in the hairs, was suggested to correspond to extreme dilution of the phaeomelanin, by both the expression of only phaeomelanin (locus E) and its extreme dilution (locus I). To go further, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a multiple breed approach. The first GWAS, using 34 white dogs and 128 non-white dogs, including White Shepherds, Poodles, Cotons de Tulear and Bichons allowed us to identify two significantly associated loci on the locus E and a novel locus on chromosome 20. A second GWAS using 15 other breeds presenting extreme phaeomelanin dilution confirmed the position of locus I on the chromosome 20 (position 55 Mb pcorrected = 6 x 10(-13)). Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified a missense variant in the first exon of MFSD12, a gene recently identified to be involved in human, mouse and horse pigmentation. We confirmed the role of this variant in phaeomelanin dilution of numerous canine breeds, and the conserved role of MFSD12 in mammalian pigmentation.},

abstract = {While the long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a large portion of the mammalian transcriptome, their biological functions has remained elusive. A few long ncRNAs that have been studied in any detail silence gene expression in processes such as X-inactivation and imprinting. We used a GENCODE annotation of the human genome to characterize over a thousand long ncRNAs that are expressed in multiple cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found an enhancer-like function for a set of these long ncRNAs in human cell lines. Depletion of a number of ncRNAs led to decreased expression of their neighboring protein-coding genes, including the master regulator of hematopoiesis, SCL (also called TAL1), Snai1 and Snai2. Using heterologous transcription assays we demonstrated a requirement for the ncRNAs in activation of gene expression. These results reveal an unanticipated role for a class of long ncRNAs in activation of critical regulators of development and differentiation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among mammals for which there is a high sequence coverage, the whole  genome assembly of the dog is unique in that it predicts a low number of protein-coding genes, {\~{}}19,000, compared to the over 20,000 reported for other mammalian species. Of particular interest are the more than 400 of genes annotated in primates and rodent genomes, but missing in dog. RESULTS: Using over 14,000 orthologous genes between human, chimpanzee, mouse rat and dog, we built multiple pairwise synteny maps to infer short orthologous intervals that were targeted for characterizing the canine missing genes. Based on gene prediction and a functionality test using the ratio of replacement to silent nucleotide substitution rates (d(N)/d(S)), we provide compelling structural and functional evidence for the identification of 232 new protein-coding genes in the canine genome and 69 gene losses, characterized as undetected gene or pseudogenes. Gene loss phyletic pattern analysis using ten species from chicken to human allowed us to characterize 28 canine-specific gene losses that have functional orthologs continuously from chicken or marsupials through human, and 10 genes that arose specifically in the evolutionary lineage leading to rodent and primates. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the central role of comparative genomics for refining gene catalogs and exploring the evolutionary history of gene repertoires, particularly as applied for the characterization of species-specific gene gains and losses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevailing paradigm of host-parasite evolution is that arms races lead to increasing specialisation via genetic adaptation. Insect herbivores are no exception and the majority have evolved to colonise a small number of closely related host species. Remarkably, the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, colonises plant species across 40 families and single M. persicae clonal lineages can colonise distantly related plants. This remarkable ability makes M. persicae a highly destructive pest of many important crop species. RESULTS: To investigate the exceptional phenotypic plasticity of M. persicae, we sequenced the M. persicae genome and assessed how one clonal lineage responds to host plant species of different families. We show that genetically identical individuals are able to colonise distantly related host species through the differential regulation of genes belonging to aphid-expanded gene families. Multigene clusters collectively upregulate in single aphids within two days upon host switch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional significance of this rapid transcriptional change using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down of genes belonging to the cathepsin B gene family. Knock-down of cathepsin B genes reduced aphid fitness, but only on the host that induced upregulation of these genes. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has focused on the role of genetic adaptation of parasites to their hosts. Here we show that the generalist aphid pest M. persicae is able to colonise diverse host plant species in the absence of genetic specialisation. This is achieved through rapid transcriptional plasticity of genes that have duplicated during aphid evolution.},

abstract = {Human Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathies (HSANs) are characterized by insensitivity to pain, sometimes combined with self-mutilation. Strikingly, several sporting dog breeds are particularly affected by such neuropathies. Clinical signs appear in young puppies and consist of acral analgesia, with or without sudden intense licking, biting and severe self-mutilation of the feet, whereas proprioception, motor abilities and spinal reflexes remain intact. Through a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) with 24 affected and 30 unaffected sporting dogs using the Canine HD 170K SNP array (Illumina), we identified a 1.8 Mb homozygous locus on canine chromosome 4 (adj. p-val = 2.5x10-6). Targeted high-throughput sequencing of this locus in 4 affected and 4 unaffected dogs identified 478 variants. Only one variant perfectly segregated with the expected recessive inheritance in 300 sporting dogs of known clinical status, while it was never present in 900 unaffected dogs from 130 other breeds. This variant, located 90 kb upstream of the GDNF gene, a highly relevant neurotrophic factor candidate gene, lies in a long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), GDNF-AS. Using human comparative genomic analysis, we observed that the canine variant maps onto an enhancer element. Quantitative RT-PCR of dorsal root ganglia RNAs of affected dogs showed a significant decrease of both GDNF mRNA and GDNF-AS expression levels (respectively 60{\%} and 80{\%}), as compared to unaffected dogs. We thus performed gel shift assays (EMSA) that reveal that the canine variant significantly alters the binding of regulatory elements. Altogether, these results allowed the identification in dogs of GDNF as a relevant candidate for human HSAN and insensitivity to pain, but also shed light on the regulation of GDNF transcription. Finally, such results allow proposing these sporting dog breeds as natural models for clinical trials with a double benefit for human and veterinary medicine.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) has the potential to greatly expand the functional repertoire of mammalian transcriptomes. However, few variant transcripts have been characterized functionally, making it difficult to assess the contribution of AS to the generation of phenotypic complexity and to study the evolution of splicing patterns. We have compared the AS of 309 protein-coding genes in the human ENCODE pilot regions against their mouse orthologs in unprecedented detail, utilizing traditional transcriptomic and RNAseq data. The conservation status of every transcript has been investigated, and each functionally categorized as coding (separated into coding sequence [CDS] or nonsense-mediated decay [NMD] linked) or noncoding. In total, 36.7{\%} of human and 19.3{\%} of mouse coding transcripts are species specific, and we observe a 3.6 times excess of human NMD transcripts compared with mouse; in contrast to previous studies, the majority of species-specific AS is unlinked to transposable elements. We observe one conserved CDS variant and one conserved NMD variant per 2.3 and 11.4 genes, respectively. Subsequently, we identify and characterize equivalent AS patterns for 22.9{\%} of these CDS or NMD-linked events in nonmammalian vertebrate genomes, and our data indicate that functional NMD-linked AS is more widespread and ancient than previously thought. Furthermore, although we observe an association between conserved AS and elevated sequence conservation, as previously reported, we emphasize that 30{\%} of conserved AS exons display sequence conservation below the average score for constitutive exons. In conclusion, we demonstrate the value of detailed comparative annotation in generating a comprehensive set of AS transcripts, increasing our understanding of AS evolution in vertebrates. Our data supports a model whereby the acquisition of functional AS has occurred throughout vertebrate evolution and is considered alongside amino acid change as a key mechanism in gene evolution.},

abstract = {The extraordinary phenotypic diversity of dog breeds has been sculpted by a unique population history accompanied by selection for novel and desirable traits. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis using multiple test statistics to identify regions under selection in 509 dogs from 46 diverse breeds using a newly developed high-density genotyping array consisting of {\textgreater}170,000 evenly spaced SNPs. We first identify 44 genomic regions exhibiting extreme differentiation across multiple breeds. Genetic variation in these regions correlates with variation in several phenotypic traits that vary between breeds, and we identify novel associations with both morphological and behavioral traits. We next scan the genome for signatures of selective sweeps in single breeds, characterized by long regions of reduced heterozygosity and fixation of extended haplotypes. These scans identify hundreds of regions, including 22 blocks of homozygosity longer than one megabase in certain breeds. Candidate selection loci are strongly enriched for developmental genes. We chose one highly differentiated region, associated with body size and ear morphology, and characterized it using high-throughput sequencing to provide a list of variants that may directly affect these traits. This study provides a catalogue of genomic regions showing extreme reduction in genetic variation or population differentiation in dogs, including many linked to phenotypic variation. The many blocks of reduced haplotype diversity observed across the genome in dog breeds are the result of both selection and genetic drift, but extended blocks of homozygosity on a megabase scale appear to be best explained by selection. Further elucidation of the variants under selection will help to uncover the genetic basis of complex traits and disease.},

abstract = {The human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). While  several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene.},
