abstract: Accurate and comprehensive sequence coverage for large genomes has been
  restricted to only a few species of specific interest. Lower sequence coverage (survey
  sequencing) of related species can yield a wealth of information about gene content
  and putative regulatory elements. But survey sequences lack long-range continuity
  and provide only a fragmented view of a genome. Here we show the usefulness of combining
  survey sequencing with dense radiation-hybrid (RH) maps for extracting maximum comparative
  genome information from model organisms. Based on results from the canine system,
  we propose that from now on all low-pass sequencing projects should be accompanied
  by a dense, gene-based RH map-construction effort to extract maximum information
  from the genome with a marginal extra cost.
