abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Comparative genomics studies are central in identifying the
  coding and non-coding elements associated with complex traits, and the functional
  annotation of genomes is a critical step to decipher the genotype-to-phenotype relationships
  in livestock animals. As part of the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG)
  action, the FR-AgENCODE project aimed to create reference functional maps of domesticated
  animals by profiling the landscape of transcription (RNA-seq), chromatin accessibility
  (ATAC-seq) and conformation (Hi-C) in species representing ruminants (cattle, goat),
  monogastrics (pig) and birds (chicken), using three target samples related to metabolism
  (liver) and immunity (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). RESULTS: RNA-seq assays considerably
  extended the available catalog of annotated transcripts and identified differentially
  expressed genes with unknown function, including new syntenic lncRNAs. ATAC-seq
  highlighted an enrichment for transcription factor binding sites in differentially
  accessible regions of the chromatin. Comparative analyses revealed a core set of
  conserved regulatory regions across species. Topologically associating domains (TADs)
  and epigenetic A/B compartments annotated from Hi-C data were consistent with RNA-seq
  and ATAC-seq data. Multi-species comparisons showed that conserved TAD boundaries
  had stronger insulation properties than species-specific ones and that the genomic
  distribution of orthologous genes in A/B compartments was significantly conserved
  across species. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first multi-species and multi-assay genome
  annotation results obtained by a FAANG project. Beyond the generation of reference
  annotations and the confirmation of previous findings on model animals, the integrative
  analysis of data from multiple assays and species sheds a new light on the multi-scale
  selective pressure shaping genome organization from birds to mammals. Overall, these
  results emphasize the value of FAANG for research on domesticated animals and reinforces
  the importance of future meta-analyses of the reference datasets being generated
  by this community on different species.'
