abstract: The extraordinary phenotypic diversity of dog breeds has been sculpted by
  a unique population history accompanied by selection for novel and desirable traits.
  Here we perform a comprehensive analysis using multiple test statistics to identify
  regions under selection in 509 dogs from 46 diverse breeds using a newly developed
  high-density genotyping array consisting of textgreater170,000 evenly spaced SNPs.
  We first identify 44 genomic regions exhibiting extreme differentiation across multiple
  breeds. Genetic variation in these regions correlates with variation in several
  phenotypic traits that vary between breeds, and we identify novel associations with
  both morphological and behavioral traits. We next scan the genome for signatures
  of selective sweeps in single breeds, characterized by long regions of reduced heterozygosity
  and fixation of extended haplotypes. These scans identify hundreds of regions, including
  22 blocks of homozygosity longer than one megabase in certain breeds. Candidate
  selection loci are strongly enriched for developmental genes. We chose one highly
  differentiated region, associated with body size and ear morphology, and characterized
  it using high-throughput sequencing to provide a list of variants that may directly
  affect these traits. This study provides a catalogue of genomic regions showing
  extreme reduction in genetic variation or population differentiation in dogs, including
  many linked to phenotypic variation. The many blocks of reduced haplotype diversity
  observed across the genome in dog breeds are the result of both selection and genetic
  drift, but extended blocks of homozygosity on a megabase scale appear to be best
  explained by selection. Further elucidation of the variants under selection will
  help to uncover the genetic basis of complex traits and disease.
