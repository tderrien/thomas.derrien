abstract: Mucosal melanomas (MM) are rare aggressive cancers in humans, and one of
  the most common forms of oral cancers in dogs. Similar biological and histological
  features are shared between MM in both species, making dogs a powerful model for
  comparative oncology studies of melanomas. Although exome sequencing recently identified
  recurrent coding mutations in canine MM, little is known about changes in non-coding
  gene expression, and more particularly, in canine long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs),
  which are commonly dysregulated in human cancers. Here, we sampled a large cohort
  (n = 52) of canine normal/tumor oral MM from three predisposed breeds (poodles,
  Labrador retrievers, and golden retrievers), and used deep transcriptome sequencing
  to identify more than 400 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs. We further prioritized
  candidate lncRNAs by comparative genomic analysis to pinpoint 26 dog–human conserved
  DE lncRNAs, including SOX21-AS, ZEB2-AS, and CASC15 lncRNAs. Using unsupervised
  co-expression network analysis with coding genes, we inferred the potential functions
  of the DE lncRNAs, suggesting associations with cancer-related genes, cell cycle,
  and carbohydrate metabolism Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Finally, we exploited our
  multi-breed design to identify DE lncRNAs within breeds. This study provides a unique
  transcriptomic resource for studying oral melanoma in dogs, and highlights lncRNAs
  that may potentially be diagnostic or therapeutic targets for human and veterinary
  medicine.
