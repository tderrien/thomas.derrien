abstract: The development of high throughput sequencing technologies (HTS) has allowed
  researchers to better assess the complexity and diversity of the transcriptome.
  Among the many classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) identified the last decade, long
  non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a diverse and numerous repertoire of important
  ncRNAs, reinforcing the view that they are of central importance to the cell machinery
  in all branches of life. Although lncRNAs have been involved in essential biological
  processes such as imprinting, gene regulation or dosage compensation especially
  in mammals, the repertoire of lncRNAs is poorly characterized for many non-model
  organisms. In this review, we first focus on what is known about experimentally
  validated lncRNAs in insects and then review bioinformatic methods to annotate lncRNAs
  in the genomes of hexapods.
