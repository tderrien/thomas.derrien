abstract: The development of High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) for RNA profiling (RNA-seq)
  has shed light on the diversity of transcriptomes. While RNA-seq is becoming a de
  facto standard for monitoring the population of expressed transcripts in a given
  condition at a specific time, processing the huge amount of data it generates requires
  dedicated bioinformatics programs. Here, we describe a standard bioinformatics protocol
  using state-of-the-art tools, the STAR mapper to align reads onto a reference genome,
  Cufflinks to reconstruct the transcriptome, and RSEM to quantify expression levels
  of genes and transcripts. We present the workflow using human transcriptome sequencing
  data from two biological replicates of the K562 cell line produced as part of the
  ENCODE3 project.
