abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Improving functional annotation of the chicken genome is a
  key challenge in bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype. Among all transcribed
  regions, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a major component of the transcriptome
  and its regulation, and whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has greatly improved
  their identification and characterization. We performed an extensive profiling of
  the lncRNA transcriptome in the chicken liver and adipose tissue by RNA-Seq. We
  focused on these two tissues because of their importance in various economical traits
  for which energy storage and mobilization play key roles and also because of their
  high cell homogeneity. To predict lncRNAs, we used a recently developed tool called
  FEELnc, which also classifies them with respect to their distance and strand orientation
  to the closest protein-coding genes. Moreover, to confidently identify the genes/transcripts
  expressed in each tissue (a complex task for weakly expressed molecules such as
  lncRNAs), we probed a particularly large number of biological replicates (16 per
  tissue) compared to common multi-tissue studies with a larger set of tissues but
  less sampling. RESULTS: We predicted 2193 lncRNA genes, among which 1670 were robustly
  expressed across replicates in the liver and/or adipose tissue and which were classified
  into 1493 intergenic and 177 intragenic lncRNAs located between and within protein-coding
  genes, respectively. We observed similar structural features between chickens and
  mammals, with strong synteny conservation but without sequence conservation. As
  previously reported, we confirm that lncRNAs have a lower and more tissue-specific
  expression than mRNAs. Finally, we showed that adjacent lncRNA-mRNA genes in divergent
  orientation have a higher co-expression level when separated by less than 1 kb compared
  to more distant divergent pairs. Among these, we highlighted for the first time
  a novel lncRNA candidate involved in lipid metabolism, lnc_DHCR24, which is highly
  correlated with the DHCR24 gene that encodes a key enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis.
  CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive lncRNA repertoire in the chicken liver and
  adipose tissue, which shows interesting patterns of co-expression between mRNAs
  and lncRNAs. It contributes to improving the structural and functional annotation
  of the chicken genome and provides a basis for further studies on energy storage
  and mobilization traits in the chicken.'
