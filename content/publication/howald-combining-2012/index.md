abstract: Within the ENCODE Consortium, GENCODE aimed to accurately annotate all protein-coding
  genes, pseudogenes, and noncoding transcribed loci in the human genome through manual
  curation and computational methods. Annotated transcript structures were assessed,
  and less well-supported loci were systematically, experimentally validated. Predicted
  exon-exon junctions were evaluated by RT-PCR amplification followed by highly multiplexed
  sequencing readout, a method we called RT-PCR-seq. Seventy-nine percent of all assessed
  junctions are confirmed by this evaluation procedure, demonstrating the high quality
  of the GENCODE gene set. RT-PCR-seq was also efficient to screen gene models predicted
  using the Human Body Map (HBM) RNA-seq data. We validated 73% of these predictions,
  thus confirming 1168 novel genes, mostly noncoding, which will further complement
  the GENCODE annotation. Our novel experimental validation pipeline is extremely
  sensitive, far more than unbiased transcriptome profiling through RNA sequencing,
  which is becoming the norm. For example, exon-exon junctions unique to GENCODE annotated
  transcripts are five times more likely to be corroborated with our targeted approach
  than with extensive large human transcriptome profiling. Data sets such as the HBM
  and ENCODE RNA-seq data fail sampling of low-expressed transcripts. Our RT-PCR-seq
  targeted approach also has the advantage of identifying novel exons of known genes,
  as we discovered unannotated exons in âˆ¼11% of assessed introns. We thus estimate
  that at least 18% of known loci have yet-unannotated exons. Our work demonstrates
  that the cataloging of all of the genic elements encoded in the human genome will
  necessitate a coordinated effort between unbiased and targeted approaches, like
  RNA-seq and RT-PCR-seq.
