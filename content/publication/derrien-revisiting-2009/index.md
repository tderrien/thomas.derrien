abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Among mammals for which there is a high sequence coverage,
  the whole genome assembly of the dog is unique in that it predicts a low number
  of protein-coding genes, $sim$19,000, compared to the over 20,000 reported for other
  mammalian species. Of particular interest are the more than 400 of genes annotated
  in primates and rodent genomes, but missing in dog. RESULTS: Using over 14,000 orthologous
  genes between human, chimpanzee, mouse rat and dog, we built multiple pairwise synteny
  maps to infer short orthologous intervals that were targeted for characterizing
  the canine missing genes. Based on gene prediction and a functionality test using
  the ratio of replacement to silent nucleotide substitution rates (d(N)/d(S)), we
  provide compelling structural and functional evidence for the identification of
  232 new protein-coding genes in the canine genome and 69 gene losses, characterized
  as undetected gene or pseudogenes. Gene loss phyletic pattern analysis using ten
  species from chicken to human allowed us to characterize 28 canine-specific gene
  losses that have functional orthologs continuously from chicken or marsupials through
  human, and 10 genes that arose specifically in the evolutionary lineage leading
  to rodent and primates. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the central role of
  comparative genomics for refining gene catalogs and exploring the evolutionary history
  of gene repertoires, particularly as applied for the characterization of species-specific
  gene gains and losses.'
