abstract: The GENCODE Consortium aims to identify all gene features in the human genome
  using a combination of computational analysis, manual annotation, and experimental
  validation. Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new
  protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts
  annotated has steadily increased. The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding
  and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented
  in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long
  noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form
  consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation
  and found that 35% of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters
  and 62% of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE
  protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry
  spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map
  2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127
  consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding
  loci. GENCODE 7 is publicly available from gencodegenes.org and via the Ensembl
  and UCSC Genome Browsers.
