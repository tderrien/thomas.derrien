abstract: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has become an attractive biomarker in human
  oncology, and its use may be informative in canine cancer. Thus, we used droplet
  digital PCR or PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement, to explore tumor-specific
  point mutations, copy number alterations, and chromosomal rearrangements in the
  plasma of cancer-affected dogs. We detected ctDNA in 21/23 (91.3%) of histiocytic
  sarcoma (HS), 2/8 (25%) of oral melanoma, and 12/13 (92.3%) of lymphoma cases. The
  utility of ctDNA in diagnosing HS was explored in 133 dogs, including 49 with HS,
  and the screening of recurrent PTPN11 mutations in plasma had a specificity of 98.8%
  and a sensitivity between 42.8 and 77% according to the clinical presentation of
  HS. Sensitivity was greater in visceral forms and especially related to pulmonary
  location. Follow-up of four dogs by targeting lymphoma-specific antigen receptor
  rearrangement in plasma showed that minimal residual disease detection was concordant
  with clinical evaluation and treatment response. Thus, our study shows that ctDNA
  is detectable in the plasma of cancer-affected dogs and is a promising biomarker
  for diagnosis and clinical follow-up. ctDNA detection appears to be useful in comparative
  oncology research due to growing interest in the study of natural canine tumors
  and exploration of new therapies.
