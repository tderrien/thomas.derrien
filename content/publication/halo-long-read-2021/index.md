abstract: textlessptextgreaterTechnological advances have allowed improvements in
  genome reference sequence assemblies. Here, we combined long- and short-read sequence
  resources to assemble the genome of a female Great Dane dog. This assembly has improved
  continuity compared to the existing Boxer-derived (CanFam3.1) reference genome.
  Annotation of the Great Dane assembly identified 22,182 protein-coding gene models
  and 7,049 long noncoding RNAs, including 49 protein-coding genes not present in
  the CanFam3.1 reference. The Great Dane assembly spans the majority of sequence
  gaps in the CanFam3.1 reference and illustrates that 2,151 gaps overlap the transcription
  start site of a predicted protein-coding gene. Moreover, a subset of the resolved
  gaps, which have an 80.95% median GC content, localize to transcription start sites
  and recombination hotspots more often than expected by chance, suggesting the stable
  canine recombinational landscape has shaped genome architecture. Alignment of the
  Great Dane and CanFam3.1 assemblies identified 16,834 deletions and 15,621 insertions,
  as well as 2,665 deletions and 3,493 insertions located on secondary contigs. These
  structural variants are dominated by retrotransposon insertion/deletion polymorphisms
  and include 16,221 dimorphic canine short interspersed elements (SINECs) and 1,121
  dimorphic long interspersed element-1 sequences (LINE-1_Cfs). Analysis of sequences
  flanking the 3′ end of LINE-1_Cfs (i.e., LINE-1_Cf 3′-transductions) suggests multiple
  retrotransposition-competent LINE-1_Cfs segregate among dog populations. Consistent
  with this conclusion, we demonstrate that a canine LINE-1_Cf element with intact
  open reading frames can retrotranspose its own RNA and that of a SINEC_Cf consensus
  sequence in cultured human cells, implicating ongoing retrotransposon activity as
  a driver of canine genetic variation.textless/ptextgreater
