abstract: We present a fast mapping-based algorithm to compute the mappability of
  each region of a reference genome up to a specified number of mismatches. Knowing
  the mappability of a genome is crucial for the interpretation of massively parallel
  sequencing experiments. We investigate the properties of the mappability of eukaryotic
  DNA/RNA both as a whole and at the level of the gene family, providing for various
  organisms tracks which allow the mappability information to be visually explored.
  In addition, we show that mappability varies greatly between species and gene classes.
  Finally, we suggest several practical applications where mappability can be used
  to refine the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data (SNP calling, gene expression
  quantification and paired-end experiments). This work highlights mappability as
  an important concept which deserves to be taken into full account, in particular
  when massively parallel sequencing technologies are employed. The GEM mappability
  program belongs to the GEM (GEnome Multitool) suite of programs, which can be freely
  downloaded for any use from its website (http://gemlibrary.sourceforge.net).
