abstract: Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is a rare but aggressive cancer in both humans
  and dogs. The spontaneous canine model, which has clinical, epidemiological, and
  histological similarities with human HS and specific breed predispositions, provides
  a unique opportunity to unravel the genetic basis of this cancer. In this study,
  we aimed to identify germline risk factors associated with the development of HS
  in canine-predisposed breeds. We used a methodology that combined several genome-wide
  association studies in a multi-breed and multi-cancer approach as well as targeted
  next-generation sequencing, and imputation We combined several dog breeds (Bernese
  mountain dogs, Rottweilers, flat-coated retrievers, and golden retrievers), and
  three hematopoietic cancers (HS, lymphoma, and mast cell tumor). Results showed
  that we not only refined the previously identified HS risk CDKN2A locus, but also
  identified new loci on canine chromosomes 2, 5, 14, and 20. Capture and targeted
  sequencing of specific loci suggested the existence of regulatory variants in non-coding
  regions and methylation mechanisms linked to risk haplotypes, which lead to strong
  cancer predisposition in specific dog breeds. We also showed that these canine cancer
  predisposing loci appeared to be due to the additive effect of several risk haplotypes
  involved in other hematopoietic cancers such as lymphoma or mast cell tumors as
  well. This illustrates the pleiotropic nature of these canine cancer loci as observed
  in human oncology, thereby reinforcing the interest of predisposed dog breeds to
  study cancer initiation and progression.
