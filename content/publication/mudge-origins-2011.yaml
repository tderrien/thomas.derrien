abstract: Alternative splicing (AS) has the potential to greatly expand the functional
  repertoire of mammalian transcriptomes. However, few variant transcripts have been
  characterized functionally, making it difficult to assess the contribution of AS
  to the generation of phenotypic complexity and to study the evolution of splicing
  patterns. We have compared the AS of 309 protein-coding genes in the human ENCODE
  pilot regions against their mouse orthologs in unprecedented detail, utilizing traditional
  transcriptomic and RNAseq data. The conservation status of every transcript has
  been investigated, and each functionally categorized as coding (separated into coding
  sequence [CDS] or nonsense-mediated decay [NMD] linked) or noncoding. In total,
  36.7% of human and 19.3% of mouse coding transcripts are species specific, and we
  observe a 3.6 times excess of human NMD transcripts compared with mouse; in contrast
  to previous studies, the majority of species-specific AS is unlinked to transposable
  elements. We observe one conserved CDS variant and one conserved NMD variant per
  2.3 and 11.4 genes, respectively. Subsequently, we identify and characterize equivalent
  AS patterns for 22.9% of these CDS or NMD-linked events in nonmammalian vertebrate
  genomes, and our data indicate that functional NMD-linked AS is more widespread
  and ancient than previously thought. Furthermore, although we observe an association
  between conserved AS and elevated sequence conservation, as previously reported,
  we emphasize that 30% of conserved AS exons display sequence conservation below
  the average score for constitutive exons. In conclusion, we demonstrate the value
  of detailed comparative annotation in generating a comprehensive set of AS transcripts,
  increasing our understanding of AS evolution in vertebrates. Our data supports a
  model whereby the acquisition of functional AS has occurred throughout vertebrate
  evolution and is considered alongside amino acid change as a key mechanism in gene
  evolution.
