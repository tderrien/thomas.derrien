abstract: The human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).
  While several studies have demon- strated compelling biological and disease roles
  for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to in- vestigate
  these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here,
  we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced
  by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising
  9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate
  that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes,
  with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths.
  In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward
  two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus,
  and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under
  stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences—particularly in their
  promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding
  genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage.
  Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions
  shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and
  display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-
  specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates
  that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression
  of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource
  for future studies of lncRNAs.
