abstract: The identification of dog genes and their accurate localization to chromosomes
  remain a major challenge in the postgenomics era. The 132 annotated canine genes
  with human orthologs remaining in the unassembled part (chrUnknown) of the dog sequence
  assembly (CanFam1) are of limited use for candidate gene approaches or comparative
  mapping studies. We used a two-step comparative analysis to infer a canine chromosomal
  interval for localization of the chrUn genes. We first constructed a human-dog synteny
  map, using 14,456 gene-based comparative anchors. We then mapped the 132 chrUn genes
  onto the reference (human) synteny map and identified the corresponding, orthologous
  segment on the canine map, based on conserved gene order. Our results show that
  110 chrUn genes could be localized to short intervals on 18 dog chromosomes, whereas
  22 genes remained assigned to 2 possible intervals. We extended this comparative
  analysis to multiple species, using the chimpanzee, mouse, and rat genome sequences.
  This made it possible to narrow down the intervals concerned and to increase the
  number of canine chrUn genes with an inferred chromosome location to 115. This study
  demonstrates that dog chromosomal intervals for chrUn genes can be rapidly inferred,
  using a reference species, and indicates that comparative strategies based on larger
  numbers of species may be even more effective.
