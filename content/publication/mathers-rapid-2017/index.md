abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The prevailing paradigm of host-parasite evolution is that
  arms races lead to increasing specialisation via genetic adaptation. Insect herbivores
  are no exception and the majority have evolved to colonise a small number of closely
  related host species. Remarkably, the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, colonises
  plant species across 40 families and single M. persicae clonal lineages can colonise
  distantly related plants. This remarkable ability makes M. persicae a highly destructive
  pest of many important crop species. RESULTS: To investigate the exceptional phenotypic
  plasticity of M. persicae, we sequenced the M. persicae genome and assessed how
  one clonal lineage responds to host plant species of different families. We show
  that genetically identical individuals are able to colonise distantly related host
  species through the differential regulation of genes belonging to aphid-expanded
  gene families. Multigene clusters collectively upregulate in single aphids within
  two days upon host switch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional significance
  of this rapid transcriptional change using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down
  of genes belonging to the cathepsin B gene family. Knock-down of cathepsin B genes
  reduced aphid fitness, but only on the host that induced upregulation of these genes.
  CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has focused on the role of genetic adaptation of
  parasites to their hosts. Here we show that the generalist aphid pest M. persicae
  is able to colonise diverse host plant species in the absence of genetic specialisation.
  This is achieved through rapid transcriptional plasticity of genes that have duplicated
  during aphid evolution.'
