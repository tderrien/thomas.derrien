abstract: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of heterogeneous RNAs that play
  major roles in multiple biological processes. We recently identified an extended
  repertoire of more than 10,000 lncRNAs of the domestic dog however, predicting their
  biological functionality remains challenging. In this study, we have characterised
  the expression profiles of 10,444 canine lncRNAs in 26 distinct tissue types, representing
  various anatomical systems. We showed that lncRNA expressions are mainly clustered
  by tissue type and we highlighted that 44% of canine lncRNAs are expressed in a
  tissue-specific manner. We further demonstrated that tissue-specificity correlates
  with specific families of canine transposable elements. In addition, we identified
  more than 900 conserved dog-human lncRNAs for which we show their overall reproducible
  expression patterns between dog and human through comparative transcriptomics. Finally,
  co-expression analyses of lncRNA and neighbouring protein-coding genes identified
  more than 3,400 canine lncRNAs, suggesting that functional roles of these lncRNAs
  act as regulatory elements. Altogether, this genomic and transcriptomic integrative
  study of lncRNAs constitutes a major resource to investigate genotype to phenotype
  relationships and biomedical research in the dog species.
