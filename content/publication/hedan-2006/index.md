abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Coat colours in canines have many natural phenotypic variants.
  Some of the genes and alleles involved also cause genetic developmental defects,
  which are also observed in humans and mice. We studied the genetic bases of the
  merle phenotype in dogs to shed light on the pigmentation mechanisms and to identify
  genes involved in these complex pathways. The merle phenotype includes a lack of
  eumelanic pigmentation and developmental defects, hearing impairments and microphthalmia.
  It is similar to that observed in microphthalmia mouse mutants. RESULTS: Taking
  advantage of the dog as a powerful genetic model and using recently available genomic
  resources, we investigated the segregation of the merle phenotype in a five-generation
  pedigree, comprising 96 sampled Australian shepherd dogs. Genetic linkage analysis
  allowed us to identify a locus for the merle phenotype, spanning 5.5 megabases,
  at the centromeric tip of canine chromosome 10 (CFA10). This locus was supported
  by a Lod score of 15.65 at a recombination fraction theta = 0. Linkage analysis
  in three other breeds revealed that the same region is linked to the merle phenotype.
  This region, which is orthologous to human chromosome 12 (HSA12 q13-q14), belongs
  to a conserved ordered segment in the human and mouse genome and comprises several
  genes potentially involved in pigmentation and development. CONCLUSION: This study
  has identified the locus for the merle coat colour in dogs to be at the centromeric
  end of CFA10. Genetic studies on other breeds segregating the merle phenotype should
  allow the locus to be defined more accurately with the aim of identifying the gene.
  This work shows the power of the canine system to search for the genetic bases of
  mammalian pigmentation and developmental pathways.'
