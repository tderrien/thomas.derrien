abstract: Human Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathies (HSANs) are characterized
  by insensitivity to pain, sometimes combined with self-mutilation. Strikingly, several
  sporting dog breeds are particularly affected by such neuropathies. Clinical signs
  appear in young puppies and consist of acral analgesia, with or without sudden intense
  licking, biting and severe self-mutilation of the feet, whereas proprioception,
  motor abilities and spinal reflexes remain intact. Through a Genome Wide Association
  Study (GWAS) with 24 affected and 30 unaffected sporting dogs using the Canine HD
  170K SNP array (Illumina), we identified a 1.8 Mb homozygous locus on canine chromosome
  4 (adj. p-val = 2.5x10-6). Targeted high-throughput sequencing of this locus in
  4 affected and 4 unaffected dogs identified 478 variants. Only one variant perfectly
  segregated with the expected recessive inheritance in 300 sporting dogs of known
  clinical status, while it was never present in 900 unaffected dogs from 130 other
  breeds. This variant, located 90 kb upstream of the GDNF gene, a highly relevant
  neurotrophic factor candidate gene, lies in a long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA),
  GDNF-AS. Using human comparative genomic analysis, we observed that the canine variant
  maps onto an enhancer element. Quantitative RT-PCR of dorsal root ganglia RNAs of
  affected dogs showed a significant decrease of both GDNF mRNA and GDNF-AS expression
  levels (respectively 60% and 80%), as compared to unaffected dogs. We thus performed
  gel shift assays (EMSA) that reveal that the canine variant significantly alters
  the binding of regulatory elements. Altogether, these results allowed the identification
  in dogs of GDNF as a relevant candidate for human HSAN and insensitivity to pain,
  but also shed light on the regulation of GDNF transcription. Finally, such results
  allow proposing these sporting dog breeds as natural models for clinical trials
  with a double benefit for human and veterinary medicine.
