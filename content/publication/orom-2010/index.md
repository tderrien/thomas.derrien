abstract: The human genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcribed
  from diverse genomic locations. A large set of long ncRNAs is transcribed independent
  of protein-coding genes. We have used the GENCODE annotation of the human genome
  to identify 3019 long ncRNAs expressed in various human cell lines and tissue. This
  set of long ncRNAs responds to differentiation signals in primary human keratinocytes
  and is coexpressed with important regulators of keratinocyte development. Depletion
  of a number of these long ncRNAs leads to the repression of specific genes in their
  surrounding locus, supportive of an activating function for ncRNAs. Using reporter
  assays, we confirmed such activating function and show that such transcriptional
  enhancement is mediated through the long ncRNA transcripts. Our studies show that
  long ncRNAs exhibit functions similar to classically defined enhancers, through
  an RNA-dependent mechanism.
