abstract: While the long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a large portion of the
  mammalian transcriptome, their biological functions has remained elusive. A few
  long ncRNAs that have been studied in any detail silence gene expression in processes
  such as X-inactivation and imprinting. We used a GENCODE annotation of the human
  genome to characterize over a thousand long ncRNAs that are expressed in multiple
  cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found an enhancer-like function for a set of these
  long ncRNAs in human cell lines. Depletion of a number of ncRNAs led to decreased
  expression of their neighboring protein-coding genes, including the master regulator
  of hematopoiesis, SCL (also called TAL1), Snai1 and Snai2. Using heterologous transcription
  assays we demonstrated a requirement for the ncRNAs in activation of gene expression.
  These results reveal an unanticipated role for a class of long ncRNAs in activation
  of critical regulators of development and differentiation.
