abstract: Canine oral melanoma is the first malignancy of the oral cavity in dogs
  and is characterized by a local invasiveness and a high metastatic propensity. A
  better knowledge of genetic alterations is expected to improve management of this
  tumour. Copy number alterations are known characteristics of mucosal melanomas both
  in dogs and humans. The goal of this study was to explore the prognostic value of
  somatic focal amplifications on chromosomes (Canis Familiaris [CFA]) 10 and 30 in
  canine oral melanoma. The cohort included 73 dogs with oral melanoma confirmed by
  histology, removed surgically without adjuvant therapy and with a minimal follow-up
  of 6 months. Epidemiological, clinical and histological data were collected and
  quantitative-PCR were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples
  to identify specific focal amplifications. The 73 dogs included in the study had
  a median survival time of 220 days. Focal amplifications on CFA 10 and 30 were recurrent
  (49.3% and 50.7% of cases, respectively) and CFA 30 amplification was significantly
  associated with the amelanotic phenotype (P = .046) and high mitotic index (MI;
  P = .0039). CFA 30 amplification was also linked to poor prognosis (P = .0005).
  Other negative prognostic factors included gingiva location (P = .003), lymphadenomegaly
  (P = .026), tumour ulceration at diagnosis (P = .003), MI superior to 6 mitoses
  over 10 fields (P = .001) and amelanotic tumour (P = .029). In multivariate analyses
  using Cox proportional hazards regression, CFA 30 amplification (Hazard ratio [HR]
  = 2.08; P = .011), tumour location (HR = 2.20; P = .005) and histological pigmentation
  (HR = 1.87; P = .036) were significantly associated with shorter survival time.
  Focal amplification of CFA 30 is linked to an aggressive subset and constitutes
  a new prognostic factor.
