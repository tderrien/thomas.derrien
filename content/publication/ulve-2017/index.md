abstract: 'Canine cancers represent a tremendous natural resource due to their incidence
  and striking similarities to human cancers, sharing similar clinical and pathologic
  features as well as oncogenic events, including identical somatic mutations. Considering
  the importance of gene fusions as driver alterations, we explored their relevance
  in canine cancers. We focused on three distinct human-comparable canine cancers
  representing different tissues and embryonic origins. Through RNA-Seq, we discovered
  similar gene fusions as those found in their human counterparts: IGK-CCND3 in B-cell
  lymphoma, MPB-BRAF in glioma, and COL3A1-PDGFB in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-like.
  We showed not only similar partner genes but also identical breakpoints leading
  to oncogene overexpression. This study demonstrates similar gene fusion partners
  and mechanisms in human-dog corresponding tumors and allows for selection of targeted
  therapies in preclinical and clinical trials with pet dogs prior to human trials,
  within the framework of personalized medicine. Cancer Res; 77(21); 5721-7. (c)2017
