abstract: The genome of the filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus was the first to be
  completely sequenced from within the brown algal group and has served as a key reference
  genome both for this lineage and for the stramenopiles.rnWe present a complete structural
  and functional reannotation of the Ectocarpus genome.rnThe large-scale assembly
  of the Ectocarpus genome was significantly improved and genome-wide gene re-annotation
  using extensive RNA-seq data improved the structure of 11 108 existing protein-coding
  genes and added 2030 new loci. A genome-wide analysis of splicing isoforms identified
  an average of 1.6 transcripts per locus. A large number of previously undescribed
  noncoding genes were identified and annotated, including 717 loci that produce long
  noncoding RNAs. Conservation of lncRNAs between Ectocarpus and another brown alga,
  the kelp Saccharina japonica, suggests that at least a proportion of these loci
  serve a function. Finally, a large collection of single nucleotide polymorphism-based
  markers was developed for genetic analyses. These resources are available through
  an updated and improved genome database.rnThis study significantly improves the
  utility of the Ectocarpus genome as a high-quality reference for the study of many
  important aspects of brown algal biology and as a reference for genomic analyses
  across the stramenopiles.
