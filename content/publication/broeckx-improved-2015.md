abstract: "By limiting sequencing to those sequences transcribed as mRNA, whole exome\
  \ sequencing is a cost-efficient technique often used in disease-association studies.\
  \ We developed two target enrichment designs based on the recently released annotation\
  \ of the canine genome: the exome-plus design and the exome-CDS design. The exome-plus\
  \ design combines the exons of the CanFam 3.1 Ensembl annotation, more recently\
  \ discovered protein-coding exons and a variety of non-coding RNA regions (microRNAs,\
  \ long non-coding RNAs and antisense transcripts), leading to a total size of approximately\
  \ 152 Mb. The exome-CDS was designed as a subset of the exome-plus by omitting all\
  \ 3' and 5' untranslated regions. This reduced the size of the exome-CDS to approximately\
  \ 71 Mb. To test the capturing performance, four exome-plus captures were sequenced\
  \ on a NextSeq 500 with each capture containing four pre-capture pooled, barcoded\
  \ samples. At an average sequencing depth of 68.3x, 80% of the regions and well\
  \ over 90% of the targeted base pairs were completely covered at least 5 times with\
  \ high reproducibility. Based on the performance of the exome-plus, we estimated\
  \ the performance of the exome-CDS. Overall, these designs provide flexible solutions\
  \ for a variety of research questions and are likely to be reliable tools in disease\
  \ studies."
