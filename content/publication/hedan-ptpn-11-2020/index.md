abstract: 'In humans, histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an aggressive cancer involving histiocytes.
  Its rarity and heterogeneity explain that treatment remains a challenge. Sharing
  high clinical and histopathological similarities with human HS, the canine HS is
  conversely frequent in specific breeds and thus constitutes a unique spontaneous
  model for human HS to decipher the genetic bases and to explore therapeutic options.
  We identified sequence alterations in the MAPK pathway in at least 63.9% (71/111)
  of HS cases with mutually exclusive BRAF (0.9%; 1/111), KRAS (7.2%; 8/111) and PTPN11
  (56.75%; 63/111) mutations concentrated at hotspots common to human cancers. Recurrent
  PTPN11 mutations are associated to visceral disseminated HS subtype in dogs, the
  most aggressive clinical presentation. We then identified PTPN11 mutations in 3/19
  (15.7%) human HS patients. Thus, we propose PTPN11 mutations as key events for a
  specific subset of human and canine HS: the visceral disseminated form. Finally,
  by testing drugs targeting the MAPK pathway in eight canine HS cell lines, we identified
  a better anti-proliferation activity of MEK inhibitors than PTPN11 inhibitors in
  canine HS neoplastic cells. In combination, these results illustrate the relevance
  of naturally affected dogs in deciphering genetic mechanisms and selecting efficient
  targeted therapies for such rare and aggressive cancers in humans.'
