abstract: The transcriptome of a cell is represented by a myriad of different RNA
  molecules with and without protein-coding capacities. In recent years, advances
  in sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to more fully appreciate the
  complexity of whole transcriptomes, showing that the vast majority of the genome
  is transcribed, producing a diverse population of non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs).
  Thus, the biological significance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been largely
  underestimated. Amongst these multiple classes of ncRNAs, the long non-coding RNAs
  (lncRNAs) are apparently the most numerous and functionally diverse. A small but
  growing number of lncRNAs have been experimentally studied, and a view is emerging
  that these are key regulators of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian cells.
  LncRNAs have already been implicated in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration,
  highlighting the importance of this emergent field. In this article, we review the
  catalogs of annotated lncRNAs and the latest advances in our understanding of lncRNAs.
