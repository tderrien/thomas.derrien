abstract = {Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has become an attractive biomarker in human oncology, and its use may be informative in canine cancer. Thus, we used droplet digital PCR or PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement, to explore tumor-specific point mutations, copy number alterations, and chromosomal rearrangements in the plasma of cancer-affected dogs. We detected ctDNA in 21/23 (91.3{\%}) of histiocytic sarcoma (HS), 2/8 (25{\%}) of oral melanoma, and 12/13 (92.3{\%}) of lymphoma cases. The utility of ctDNA in diagnosing HS was explored in 133 dogs, including 49 with HS, and the screening of recurrent PTPN11 mutations in plasma had a specificity of 98.8{\%} and a sensitivity between 42.8 and 77{\%} according to the clinical presentation of HS. Sensitivity was greater in visceral forms and especially related to pulmonary location. Follow-up of four dogs by targeting lymphoma-specific antigen receptor rearrangement in plasma showed that minimal residual disease detection was concordant with clinical evaluation and treatment response. Thus, our study shows that ctDNA is detectable in the plasma of cancer-affected dogs and is a promising biomarker for diagnosis and clinical follow-up. ctDNA detection appears to be useful in comparative oncology research due to growing interest in the study of natural canine tumors and exploration of new therapies.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (LNC) regulate numerous biological processes. In contrast to human, the identification of LNC in farm species, like chicken, is still lacunar. We propose a catalogue of 52,075 chicken genes enriched in LNC ( http://www.fragencode.org/ ), built from the Ensembl reference extended using novel LNC modelled here from 364 RNA-seq and LNC from four public databases. The Ensembl reference grew from 4,643 to 30,084 LNC, of which 59{\%} and 41{\%} with expression ≥ 0.5 and ≥ 1 TPM respectively. Characterization of these LNC relatively to the closest protein coding genes (PCG) revealed that 79{\%} of LNC are in intergenic regions, as in other species. Expression analysis across 25 tissues revealed an enrichment of co-expressed LNC:PCG pairs, suggesting co-regulation and/or co-function. As expected LNC were more tissue-specific than PCG (25{\%} vs. 10{\%}). Similarly to human, 16{\%} of chicken LNC hosted one or more miRNA. We highlighted a new chicken LNC, hosting miR155, conserved in human, highly expressed in immune tissues like miR155, and correlated with immunity-related PCG in both species. Among LNC:PCG pairs tissue-specific in the same tissue, we revealed an enrichment of divergent pairs with the PCG coding transcription factors, as for example LHX5, HXD3 and TBX4, in both human and chicken.},

abstract = {Our vision of DNA transcription and splicing has changed dramatically with the introduction of short-read sequencing. These high-throughput sequencing technologies promised to unravel the complexity of any transcriptome. Generally gene expression levels are well-captured using these technologies, but there are still remaining caveats due to the limited read length and the fact that RNA molecules had to be reverse transcribed before sequencing. Oxford Nanopore Technologies has recently launched a portable sequencer which offers the possibility of sequencing long reads and most importantly RNA molecules. Here we generated a full mouse transcriptome from brain and liver using the Oxford Nanopore device. As a comparison, we sequenced RNA (RNA-Seq) and cDNA (cDNA-Seq) molecules using both long and short reads technologies and tested the TeloPrime preparation kit, dedicated to the enrichment of full-length transcripts. Using spike-in data, we confirmed that expression levels are efficiently captured by cDNA-Seq using short reads. More importantly, Oxford Nanopore RNA-Seq tends to be more efficient, while cDNA-Seq appears to be more biased. We further show that the cDNA library preparation of the Nanopore protocol induces read truncation for transcripts containing internal runs of T's. This bias is marked for runs of at least 15 T's, but is already detectable for runs of at least 9 T's and therefore concerns more than 20{\%} of expressed transcripts in mouse brain and liver. Finally, we outline that bioinformatics challenges remain ahead for quantifying at the transcript level, especially when reads are not full-length. Accurate quantification of repeat-associated genes such as processed pseudogenes also remains difficult, and we show that current mapping protocols which map reads to the genome largely over-estimate their expression, at the expense of their parent gene.},

abstract = {White coat color in mammals has been selected several times during the domestication process. Numerous dog breeds are fixed for one form of white coat color that involves darkly pigmented skin. The genetic basis of this color, due to the absence of pigment in the hairs, was suggested to correspond to extreme dilution of the phaeomelanin, by both the expression of only phaeomelanin (locus E) and its extreme dilution (locus I). To go further, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using a multiple breed approach. The first GWAS, using 34 white dogs and 128 non-white dogs, including White Shepherds, Poodles, Cotons de Tulear and Bichons allowed us to identify two significantly associated loci on the locus E and a novel locus on chromosome 20. A second GWAS using 15 other breeds presenting extreme phaeomelanin dilution confirmed the position of locus I on the chromosome 20 (position 55 Mb pcorrected = 6 x 10(-13)). Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified a missense variant in the first exon of MFSD12, a gene recently identified to be involved in human, mouse and horse pigmentation. We confirmed the role of this variant in phaeomelanin dilution of numerous canine breeds, and the conserved role of MFSD12 in mammalian pigmentation.},

abstract = {Canine oral melanoma is the first malignancy of the oral cavity in dogs and is characterized by a local invasiveness and a high metastatic propensity. A better knowledge of genetic alterations is expected to improve management of this tumour. Copy number alterations are known characteristics of mucosal melanomas both in dogs and humans. The goal of this study was to explore the prognostic value of somatic focal amplifications on chromosomes (Canis Familiaris [CFA]) 10 and 30 in canine oral melanoma. The cohort included 73 dogs with oral melanoma confirmed by histology, removed surgically without adjuvant therapy and with a minimal follow-up of 6 months. Epidemiological, clinical and histological data were collected and quantitative-PCR were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples to identify specific focal amplifications. The 73 dogs included in the study had a median survival time of 220 days. Focal amplifications on CFA 10 and 30 were recurrent (49.3{\%} and 50.7{\%} of cases, respectively) and CFA 30 amplification was significantly associated with the amelanotic phenotype (P = .046) and high mitotic index (MI; P = .0039). CFA 30 amplification was also linked to poor prognosis (P = .0005). Other negative prognostic factors included gingiva location (P = .003), lymphadenomegaly (P = .026), tumour ulceration at diagnosis (P = .003), MI superior to 6 mitoses over 10 fields (P = .001) and amelanotic tumour (P = .029). In multivariate analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression, CFA 30 amplification (Hazard ratio [HR] = 2.08; P = .011), tumour location (HR = 2.20; P = .005) and histological pigmentation (HR = 1.87; P = .036) were significantly associated with shorter survival time. Focal amplification of CFA 30 is linked to an aggressive subset and constitutes a new prognostic factor.},

Similar biological and histological features are shared between MM in both species, making dogs a powerful model for comparative oncology studies of melanomas. Although exome sequencing recently identified recurrent coding mutations in canine MM, little is known about changes in non-coding gene expression, and more particularly, in canine long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are commonly dysregulated in human cancers. Here, we sampled a large cohort (n = 52) of canine normal/tumor oral MM from three predisposed breeds (poodles, Labrador retrievers, and golden retrievers), and used deep transcriptome sequencing to identify more than 400 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs. We further prioritized candidate lncRNAs by comparative genomic analysis to pinpoint 26 dog–human conserved DE lncRNAs, including SOX21-AS, ZEB2-AS, and CASC15 lncRNAs. Using unsupervised co-expression network analysis with coding genes, we inferred the potential functions of the DE lncRNAs, suggesting associations with cancer-related genes, cell cycle, and carbohydrate metabolism Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Finally, we exploited our multi-breed design to identify DE lncRNAs within breeds. This study provides a unique transcriptomic resource for studying oral melanoma in dogs, and highlights lncRNAs that may potentially be diagnostic or therapeutic targets for human and veterinary medicine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevailing paradigm of host-parasite evolution is that arms races lead to increasing specialisation via genetic adaptation. Insect herbivores are no exception and the majority have evolved to colonise a small number of closely related host species. Remarkably, the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, colonises plant species across 40 families and single M. persicae clonal lineages can colonise distantly related plants. This remarkable ability makes M. persicae a highly destructive pest of many important crop species. RESULTS: To investigate the exceptional phenotypic plasticity of M. persicae, we sequenced the M. persicae genome and assessed how one clonal lineage responds to host plant species of different families. We show that genetically identical individuals are able to colonise distantly related host species through the differential regulation of genes belonging to aphid-expanded gene families. Multigene clusters collectively upregulate in single aphids within two days upon host switch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functional significance of this rapid transcriptional change using RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knock-down of genes belonging to the cathepsin B gene family. Knock-down of cathepsin B genes reduced aphid fitness, but only on the host that induced upregulation of these genes. CONCLUSIONS: Previous research has focused on the role of genetic adaptation of parasites to their hosts. Here we show that the generalist aphid pest M. persicae is able to colonise diverse host plant species in the absence of genetic specialisation. This is achieved through rapid transcriptional plasticity of genes that have duplicated during aphid evolution.},

However, a disadvantage of GWAS is that it always requires subsequent fine-mapping or sequencing to pinpoint causal mutations. Here, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) and canine high-density (cHD) SNP genotyping of 28 dogs from 3 breeds to compare the SNP and linkage disequilibrium characteristics together with the power and mapping precision of exome-guided GWAS (EG-GWAS) versus cHD-based GWAS. Using simulated phenotypes, we showed that EG-GWAS has a higher power than cHD to detect associations within target regions and less power outside target regions, with power being influenced further by sample size and SNP density. We analyzed two real phenotypes (hair length and furnishing), that are fixed in certain breeds to characterize mapping precision of the known causal mutations. EG-GWAS identified the associated exonic and 3'UTR variants within the FGF5 and RSPO2 genes, respectively, with only a few samples per breed. In conclusion, we demonstrated that EG-GWAS can identify loci associated with Mendelian phenotypes both within and across breeds.},

Here, we present FEELnc (FlExible Extraction of LncRNAs), an alignment-free program that accurately annotates lncRNAs based on a Random Forest model trained with general features such as multi k-mer frequencies and relaxed open reading frames. Benchmarking versus five state-of-the-art tools shows that FEELnc achieves similar or better classification performance on GENCODE and NONCODE data sets. The program also provides specific modules that enable the user to fine-tune classification accuracy, to formalize the annotation of lncRNA classes and to identify lncRNAs even in the absence of a training set of non-coding RNAs. We used FEELnc on a real data set comprising 20 canine RNA-seq samples produced by the European LUPA consortium to substantially expand the canine genome annotation to include 10 374 novel lncRNAs and 58 640 mRNA transcripts.

abstract = {Human Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathies (HSANs) are characterized by insensitivity to pain, sometimes combined with self-mutilation. Strikingly, several sporting dog breeds are particularly affected by such neuropathies. Clinical signs appear in young puppies and consist of acral analgesia, with or without sudden intense licking, biting and severe self-mutilation of the feet, whereas proprioception, motor abilities and spinal reflexes remain intact. Through a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) with 24 affected and 30 unaffected sporting dogs using the Canine HD 170K SNP array (Illumina), we identified a 1.8 Mb homozygous locus on canine chromosome 4 (adj. p-val = 2.5x10-6). Targeted high-throughput sequencing of this locus in 4 affected and 4 unaffected dogs identified 478 variants. Only one variant perfectly segregated with the expected recessive inheritance in 300 sporting dogs of known clinical status, while it was never present in 900 unaffected dogs from 130 other breeds. This variant, located 90 kb upstream of the GDNF gene, a highly relevant neurotrophic factor candidate gene, lies in a long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNA), GDNF-AS. Using human comparative genomic analysis, we observed that the canine variant maps onto an enhancer element. Quantitative RT-PCR of dorsal root ganglia RNAs of affected dogs showed a significant decrease of both GDNF mRNA and GDNF-AS expression levels (respectively 60{\%} and 80{\%}), as compared to unaffected dogs. We thus performed gel shift assays (EMSA) that reveal that the canine variant significantly alters the binding of regulatory elements. Altogether, these results allowed the identification in dogs of GDNF as a relevant candidate for human HSAN and insensitivity to pain, but also shed light on the regulation of GDNF transcription. Finally, such results allow proposing these sporting dog breeds as natural models for clinical trials with a double benefit for human and veterinary medicine.},

abstract = {By limiting sequencing to those sequences transcribed as mRNA, whole exome sequencing is a cost-efficient technique often used in disease-association studies. We developed two target enrichment designs based on the recently released annotation of the canine genome: the exome-plus design and the exome-CDS design. The exome-plus design combines the exons of the CanFam 3.1 Ensembl annotation, more recently discovered protein-coding exons and a variety of non-coding RNA regions (microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and antisense transcripts), leading to a total size of approximately 152 Mb. The exome-CDS was designed as a subset of the exome-plus by omitting all 3' and 5' untranslated regions. This reduced the size of the exome-CDS to approximately 71 Mb. To test the capturing performance, four exome-plus captures were sequenced on a NextSeq 500 with each capture containing four pre-capture pooled, barcoded samples. At an average sequencing depth of 68.3x, 80{\%} of the regions and well over 90{\%} of the targeted base pairs were completely covered at least 5 times with high reproducibility. Based on the performance of the exome-plus, we estimated the performance of the exome-CDS. Overall, these designs provide flexible solutions for a variety of research questions and are likely to be reliable tools in disease studies.},

Expression-level estimates also varied widely across methods, even when based on similar transcript models.

The genome sequence of the domestic dog was assembled and released in 2005, providing an estimated 20,000 protein-coding genes that are a great asset to the scientific community that uses the dog system as a genetic biomedical model and for comparative and evolutionary studies. Although the canine gene set had been predicted using a combination of ab initio methods, homology studies, motif analysis, and similarity-based programs, it still requires a deep annotation of noncoding genes, alternative splicing, pseudogenes, regulatory regions, and gain and loss events. Such analyses could benefit from new sequencing technologies (RNA-Seq) to better exploit the advantages of the canine genetic system in tracking disease genes. Here, we review the catalog of canine protein-coding genes and the search for missing genes, and we propose rationales for an accurate identification of noncoding genes though next-generation sequencing.},

abstract = {Within the ENCODE Consortium, GENCODE aimed to accurately annotate all protein-coding genes, pseudogenes, and noncoding transcribed loci in the human genome through manual curation and computational methods. Annotated transcript structures were assessed, and less well-supported loci were systematically, experimentally validated. Predicted exon-exon junctions were evaluated by RT-PCR amplification followed by highly multiplexed sequencing readout, a method we called RT-PCR-seq. Seventy-nine percent of all assessed junctions are confirmed by this evaluation procedure, demonstrating the high quality of the GENCODE gene set. RT-PCR-seq was also efficient to screen gene models predicted using the Human Body Map (HBM) RNA-seq data. We validated 73{\%} of these predictions, thus confirming 1168 novel genes, mostly noncoding, which will further complement the GENCODE annotation. Our novel experimental validation pipeline is extremely sensitive, far more than unbiased transcriptome profiling through RNA sequencing, which is becoming the norm. For example, exon-exon junctions unique to GENCODE annotated transcripts are five times more likely to be corroborated with our targeted approach than with extensive large human transcriptome profiling. Data sets such as the HBM and ENCODE RNA-seq data fail sampling of low-expressed transcripts. Our RT-PCR-seq targeted approach also has the advantage of identifying novel exons of known genes, as we discovered unannotated exons in {\~{}}11{\%} of assessed introns. We thus estimate that at least 18{\%} of known loci have yet-unannotated exons. Our work demonstrates that the cataloging of all of the genic elements encoded in the human genome will necessitate a coordinated effort between unbiased and targeted approaches, like RNA-seq and RT-PCR-seq.},

abstract = {The human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). While  several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs.},

Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs.

We investigate the properties of the mappability of eukaryotic DNA/RNA both as a whole and at the level of the gene family, providing for various organisms tracks which allow the mappability information to be visually explored. In addition, we show that mappability varies greatly between species and gene classes. Finally, we suggest several practical applications where mappability can be used to refine the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data (SNP calling, gene expression quantification and paired-end experiments). This work highlights mappability as an important concept which deserves to be taken into full account, in particular when massively parallel sequencing technologies are employed.

In recent years, advances in sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to more fully appreciate the complexity of whole transcriptomes, showing that the vast majority of the genome is transcribed, producing a diverse population of non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Thus, the biological significance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been largely underestimated. Amongst these multiple classes of ncRNAs, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are apparently the most numerous and functionally diverse. A small but growing number of lncRNAs have been experimentally studied, and a view is emerging that these are key regulators of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian cells. LncRNAs have already been implicated in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, highlighting the importance of this emergent field. In this article, we review the catalogs of annotated lncRNAs and the latest advances in our understanding of lncRNAs.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) has the potential to greatly expand the functional repertoire of mammalian transcriptomes. However, few variant transcripts have been characterized functionally, making it difficult to assess the contribution of AS to the generation of phenotypic complexity and to study the evolution of splicing patterns. We have compared the AS of 309 protein-coding genes in the human ENCODE pilot regions against their mouse orthologs in unprecedented detail, utilizing traditional transcriptomic and RNAseq data. The conservation status of every transcript has been investigated, and each functionally categorized as coding (separated into coding sequence [CDS] or nonsense-mediated decay [NMD] linked) or noncoding. In total, 36.7{\%} of human and 19.3{\%} of mouse coding transcripts are species specific, and we observe a 3.6 times excess of human NMD transcripts compared with mouse; in contrast to previous studies, the majority of species-specific AS is unlinked to transposable elements. We observe one conserved CDS variant and one conserved NMD variant per 2.3 and 11.4 genes, respectively. Subsequently, we identify and characterize equivalent AS patterns for 22.9{\%} of these CDS or NMD-linked events in nonmammalian vertebrate genomes, and our data indicate that functional NMD-linked AS is more widespread and ancient than previously thought. Furthermore, although we observe an association between conserved AS and elevated sequence conservation, as previously reported, we emphasize that 30{\%} of conserved AS exons display sequence conservation below the average score for constitutive exons. In conclusion, we demonstrate the value of detailed comparative annotation in generating a comprehensive set of AS transcripts, increasing our understanding of AS evolution in vertebrates. Our data supports a model whereby the acquisition of functional AS has occurred throughout vertebrate evolution and is considered alongside amino acid change as a key mechanism in gene evolution.},

abstract = {The extraordinary phenotypic diversity of dog breeds has been sculpted by a unique population history accompanied by selection for novel and desirable traits. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis using multiple test statistics to identify regions under selection in 509 dogs from 46 diverse breeds using a newly developed high-density genotyping array consisting of {\textgreater}170,000 evenly spaced SNPs. We first identify 44 genomic regions exhibiting extreme differentiation across multiple breeds. Genetic variation in these regions correlates with variation in several phenotypic traits that vary between breeds, and we identify novel associations with both morphological and behavioral traits. We next scan the genome for signatures of selective sweeps in single breeds, characterized by long regions of reduced heterozygosity and fixation of extended haplotypes. These scans identify hundreds of regions, including 22 blocks of homozygosity longer than one megabase in certain breeds. Candidate selection loci are strongly enriched for developmental genes. We chose one highly differentiated region, associated with body size and ear morphology, and characterized it using high-throughput sequencing to provide a list of variants that may directly affect these traits. This study provides a catalogue of genomic regions showing extreme reduction in genetic variation or population differentiation in dogs, including many linked to phenotypic variation. The many blocks of reduced haplotype diversity observed across the genome in dog breeds are the result of both selection and genetic drift, but extended blocks of homozygosity on a megabase scale appear to be best explained by selection. Further elucidation of the variants under selection will help to uncover the genetic basis of complex traits and disease.},

abstract = {The human genome contains thousands of long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) transcribed from diverse genomic locations. A large set of long ncRNAs is transcribed independent of protein-coding genes. We have used the GENCODE annotation of the human genome to identify 3019 long ncRNAs expressed in various human cell lines and tissue. This set of long ncRNAs responds to differentiation signals in primary human keratinocytes and is coexpressed with important regulators of keratinocyte development. Depletion of a number of these long ncRNAs leads to the repression of specific genes in their surrounding locus, supportive of an activating function for ncRNAs. Using reporter assays, we confirmed such activating function and show that such transcriptional enhancement is mediated through the long ncRNA transcripts. Our studies show that long ncRNAs exhibit functions similar to classically defined enhancers, through an RNA-dependent mechanism.},

abstract = {While the long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) constitute a large portion of the mammalian transcriptome, their biological functions has remained elusive. A few long ncRNAs that have been studied in any detail silence gene expression in processes such as X-inactivation and imprinting. We used a GENCODE annotation of the human genome to characterize over a thousand long ncRNAs that are expressed in multiple cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found an enhancer-like function for a set of these long ncRNAs in human cell lines. Depletion of a number of ncRNAs led to decreased expression of their neighboring protein-coding genes, including the master regulator of hematopoiesis, SCL (also called TAL1), Snai1 and Snai2. Using heterologous transcription assays we demonstrated a requirement for the ncRNAs in activation of gene expression. These results reveal an unanticipated role for a class of long ncRNAs in activation of critical regulators of development and differentiation.},

abstract = {The identification of dog genes and their accurate localization to chromosomes remain a major challenge in the postgenomics era. The 132 annotated canine genes with human orthologs remaining in the unassembled part (chrUnknown) of the dog sequence assembly (CanFam1) are of limited use for candidate gene approaches or comparative mapping studies. We used a two-step comparative analysis to infer a canine chromosomal interval for localization of the chrUn genes. We first constructed a human-dog synteny map, using 14,456 gene-based comparative anchors. We then mapped the 132 chrUn genes onto the reference (human) synteny map and identified the corresponding, orthologous segment on the canine map, based on conserved gene order. Our results show that 110 chrUn genes could be localized to short intervals on 18 dog chromosomes, whereas 22 genes remained assigned to 2 possible intervals. We extended this comparative analysis to multiple species, using the chimpanzee, mouse, and rat genome sequences. This made it possible to narrow down the intervals concerned and to increase the number of canine chrUn genes with an inferred chromosome location to 115. This study demonstrates that dog chromosomal intervals for chrUn genes can be rapidly inferred, using a reference species, and indicates that comparative strategies based on larger numbers of species may be even more effective.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome maps are fundamental to the study of an organism and essential in the process of genome sequencing which in turn provides the ultimate map of the genome. The increased number of genomes being sequenced offers new opportunities for the mapping of closely related organisms. We propose here an algorithmic formalization of a genome comparison approach to marker ordering. RESULTS: In order to integrate a comparative mapping approach in the algorithmic process of map construction and selection, we propose to extend the usual statistical model describing the experimental data, here radiation hybrids (RH) data, in a statistical framework that models additionally the evolutionary relationships between a proposed map and a reference map: an existing map of the corresponding orthologous genes or markers in a closely related organism. This has concretely the effect of exploiting, in the process of map selection, the information of marker adjacencies in the related genome when the information provided by the experimental data is not conclusive for the purpose of ordering. In order to compute efficiently the map, we proceed to a reduction of the maximum likelihood estimation to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Experiments on simulated RH datasets as well as on a real RH dataset from the canine RH project show that maps produced using the likelihood defined by the new model are significantly better than maps built using the traditional RH model.

@article{Hedan2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coat colours in canines have many natural phenotypic variants. Some of the genes and alleles involved also cause genetic developmental defects, which are also observed in humans and mice. We studied the genetic bases of the merle phenotype in dogs to shed light on the pigmentation mechanisms and to identify genes involved in these complex pathways. The merle phenotype includes a lack of eumelanic pigmentation and developmental defects, hearing impairments and microphthalmia. It is similar to that observed in microphthalmia mouse mutants. RESULTS: Taking advantage of the dog as a powerful genetic model and using recently available genomic resources, we investigated the segregation of the merle phenotype in a five-generation pedigree, comprising 96 sampled Australian shepherd dogs. Genetic linkage analysis allowed us to identify a locus for the merle phenotype, spanning 5.5 megabases, at the centromeric tip of canine chromosome 10 (CFA10). This locus was supported by a Lod score of 15.65 at a recombination fraction theta = 0. Linkage analysis in three other breeds revealed that the same region is linked to the merle phenotype. This region, which is orthologous to human chromosome 12 (HSA12 q13-q14), belongs to a conserved ordered segment in the human and mouse genome and comprises several genes potentially involved in pigmentation and development. CONCLUSION: This study has identified the locus for the merle coat colour in dogs to be at the centromeric end of CFA10. Genetic studies on other breeds segregating the merle phenotype should allow the locus to be defined more accurately with the aim of identifying the gene. This work shows the power of the canine system to search for the genetic bases of mammalian pigmentation and developmental pathways.},

abstract = {Accurate and comprehensive sequence coverage for large genomes has been restricted to only a few species of specific interest. Lower sequence coverage (survey sequencing) of related species can yield a wealth of information about gene content and putative regulatory elements. But survey sequences lack long-range continuity and provide only a fragmented view of a genome. Here we show the usefulness of combining survey sequencing with dense radiation-hybrid (RH) maps for extracting maximum comparative genome information from model organisms. Based on results from the canine system, we propose that from now on all low-pass sequencing projects should be accompanied by a dense, gene-based RH map-construction effort to extract maximum information from the genome with a marginal extra cost.},
